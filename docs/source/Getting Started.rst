Getting Started
===============

Installation and Dependencies
numpy, matplotlib

The folder available on github contains all the packages you need to run your own models, including "epsilon" by Ormel & Liu, and pebble-predictor from Drazkowska. The latter has been modified slightly to incorporate into the PPOLs model. 

Then users can begin by:

import numpy

Users may best be served by forking the tutorial folder from github.
