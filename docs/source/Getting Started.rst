- jupyter >1.1.1 (recommended)


Usage
-----
Currently it is not able to install this code from e.g. pip. It is recommended interested users `clone the repository`_ into a directory of their choice and use the code available in `src/`.

.. _clone the repository: https://github.com/spmccloat/thePPOLSmodel)

The folder available on github contains all the packages you need to run your own models, including "epsilon" by Ormel & Liu, and pebble-predictor from Drazkowska. The latter has been modified slightly to incorporate into the PPOLs model. 

Users should then proceed to the "Tutorial and Exmaples" page, which is the same as the jupyter notebook "Tutorial.ipynb".
